# Poro-Party
# Overview
Our goal is to create a web-based multiplayer game to be played on a laptop or desktop environment. The theme of our game revolves around players controlling cats in a variety of small 
minigames, doing well in the minigames rewards the players' cats by letting them move farther along the overall map for the game and bringing them to the finish!
